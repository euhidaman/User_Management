# Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the register() view:
#
# Lines 17 to 21: If the view is displayed by a browser, then it will be accessed by a GET method.
#                 In that case, a template called users/register.html will be rendered.
#                 The last argument of .render() is a context, which in this case contains your custom user creation form.
#
# Lines 22 to 23: If the form is submitted, then the view will be accessed by a POST method.
#                 In that case, Django will attempt to create a user.
#                 A new CustomUserCreationForm is created using the values submitted to the form, which are contained in the request.POST object.
#
# Lines 24 to 27: If the form is valid, then a new user is created on line 25 using form.save().
#                 Then the user is logged in on line 27 using login().
#                 Finally, line 28 redirects the user to the dashboard.
